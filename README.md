# Calculator
First real project. 
Used knowledge from 'Codecademy' lessons. This incorporates buttons and CSS styling. 

Though it seems basic at first, I had a hard time figuring out how to log what the user inputs into the calculator, but eventually figured out a method which worked after spending time playing with the code. 

This took two attempts due to my failure to use CCS (styling) in the way I wanted.
